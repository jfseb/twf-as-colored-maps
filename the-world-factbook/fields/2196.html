<div class=rankOrderDesc>Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery, involving victims who are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or sexual exploitation. The International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN agency charged with addressing labor standards, employment, and social protection issues, estimates that 12.3 million people worldwide are enslaved in forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual servitude, and involuntary servitude at any given time. Human trafficking is a multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their human rights and freedoms, risking global health, promoting social breakdown, inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000, the US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), reauthorized in 2003 and 2005, which provides tools for the US to combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad. One of the law's key components is the creation of the US Department of State's annual <em>Trafficking in Persons Report</em>, which assesses the government response (i.e., the <em>current situation</em>) in some 150 countries with a significant number of victims trafficked across their borders who are recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained for forced labor or sexual exploitation.

<strong>tier rating: </strong>Tier 2 Watch List � Antigua and Barbuda does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; the 2010 law prohibiting human trafficking is flawed because it requires cases to be tried in a lower court that is unable to impose sentences as severe as those provided for other serious crimes; authorities investigated three suspected trafficking cases but no prosecutions, convictions, or punishments were reported; a government department continued to provide high-quality assistance to victims, but only one adult labor trafficking victim and no sex trafficking victims were identified during the reporting period; trafficking prevention activities were sustained<br />
